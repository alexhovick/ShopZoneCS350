* What challenges do I have?
    * I have had quite a few challenges with this milestone. I have been having a hard time with understanding the requirements for Checkpoint 1. I believe that I did everything correctly, but I am really not sure.I also am a little confused with the structure of where we should have these requirements as well. I included the markdown files for the requirements in Documents>Milestone-1>Code folder, which I am unsure if this is the correct place for them. I also had difficulty with what should be in the AppCode.md, GithubRepo.md, GithubSetup.md, and Workflow.md files since when I tried to use the GhostWriter example I only got the 404 error saying that these don't exist. 
* Engineering investment
    * I spent about 8 hours on Code for Milestone 1
    * Our team met for 6 hours  
* 5-minute Video Demo
