## What I did for Milestone 1

1. Requirement Gathering:

The requirements of the ShopZone applications were defined by the needs of our client, Mark
Seaman. The results of the Requirement Gatheringare documented in the
[ShopZone - Product Features](ShopZone-ProductFeatures.md).

2. Prioritization and Scope Definition:

The product features support goals of our client who wants to put the experience of the
customer first. The project scope and priorities and feature set are all documented
in the [ShopZone - Product Features](ShopZone-ProductFeatures.md).

3. Stakeholder Review and Approval:

I've been regularly discussing project features and plans with our professor, Mark Seaman.
This feedback-driven approach will continue throughout the project, allowing his input to
guide our development process.

I also intend to produce a video at every stage of the development to explain how the
system works. This may spark some additional feedback and renewed interest in the project.

4. Milestone Review:

Because this project is not being done to satisfy external stakeholders there is no formal
milestone review meeting or presentation. On a more typical project this is important
for a comprehensive assessment of the completed tasks, progress, and stakeholder satisfaction.
It provides an opportunity to address any potential issues or gaps before moving forward,
ensuring that the project remains on track and that everyone is aligned on the initial requirements.

5. Status Video

I created a summary of the requirements work completed. View the video at
[Milestone 1 - Requirements](Video.md)
