Client: Mark Seaman

Client communication:

    In-Class Discussions: We will actively engage with our professor during class hours to provide updates on project progress, discuss any challenges, and seek clarification on project requirements. This direct interaction will ensure real-time communication and feedback.

    Email Correspondence: In addition to in-class discussions, we will utilize email as a supplementary communication channel. We will send periodic project updates, share important documents or milestones, and address any specific questions or concerns via email.

    Regular Status Reports: To maintain transparency and keep our professor informed, we will prepare and submit regular status reports. These reports will summarize the project's progress, highlight achievements, and outline upcoming tasks or milestones. They will be sent via email and discussed in class as needed.

    Office Hours: We will take advantage of our professor's office hours to schedule one-on-one discussions when necessary. This will provide an opportunity for in-depth conversations, clarification on project details, and addressing any concerns that require a more personalized approach.

    Our goal in client communication is to ensure that our professor is well-informed about the project's status and that any feedback or guidance provided is promptly addressed. We will maintain professionalism and responsiveness in all our interactions to foster a productive working relationship.
