## 3. Version Control and Git

Our team uses Git for version control:

3. Commit your changes:
Save all your changes in Visual Studio Code. Go to Source Control. 

4. Push your changes to the remote branch:
Enter a message in source control page, and click Sync Changes

5. Create a pull request on GitHub for code review and merging.

## 4. Coding Standards and Practices

Maintaining code quality is essential:

- Follow our coding standards document for consistent naming and formatting.
- Comment your code to explain complex logic or functionality.
- Write reusable and modular code whenever possible.

## 5. Testing and Quality Assurance

Thorough testing ensures a reliable product:

- Write unit tests to validate critical functionality.
- Perform manual testing to simulate user interactions.
- Use debugging tools to identify and fix issues.

## 6. Code Review Process

Code reviews help maintain quality and catch errors:

1. Open a pull request (PR) on GitHub.
2. Team members review your code, providing feedback and suggestions.
3. Make necessary changes based on feedback.
4. Once approved, your code will be merged into the main branch.

## 7. Collaboration and Communication
