# My Experience with GitHub Copilot


### Introduction
**Installation and Setup:** Using GitHub Copilot with Visual Studio Code was straightforward. Copilot was very easy to set up, with it being an extension on VSCode and only needing to sign into GitHub to get it working.


**Exploration and Trial:** There was some trial and error with using Copilot across different coding tasks, ranging from straightforward JavaScript functions to more challenging React components.


### Key Findings:
**Code Generation Accuracy:** GitHub Copilot displayed commendable accuracy, particularly for routine React coding patterns. However, its accuracy dropped when it came to more challenging react components, needing manual tweaks to ensure code correctness.


**Productivity Gains:** From my testing, Copilot emerged as a game-changer for routine JavaScript and React coding tasks. The tool's suggestions sped along the coding process; even with the errors that would occur, they were usually easy to fix. I can see that learning more about Copilot and becoming more used to it can definitely speed along the development process.


**Learning Curve:** It was not too challenging to learn how to use Copilot. Its integration with VSCode helped with its ease of use. I am sure there are multiple features that Copilot has that I have yet to learn.


### Challenges:
**Code Understanding Limitations:** Copilot exhibited occasional hiccups in understanding highly specific React requirements. While adept at routine React tasks, it occasionally struggled in more specialized scenarios.


### Conclusion:
My exploration of GitHub Copilot with React and JavaScript has unearthed its potential as a valuable coding ally. While excelling in routine tasks, Copilot's effectiveness in React projects introduces a new dimension to my development toolkit.
As I learn more about Copilot and all it can do, I see it being my most useful tool when coding.


### Recommendations:
Integrating Copilot into a programmer's development workflow can increase the productivity and speed of development.
Learning all of Copilot's current features will also help in getting all you can out of this helpful tool. Checking regularly with GitHub and OpenAI for updates and improvements will help to ensure you get all you can out of Copilot.
