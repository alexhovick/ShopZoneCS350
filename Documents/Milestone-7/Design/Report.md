# Engineering Report

## Milestone 7 - Design - Elmore Siahaan

* What did I do?
    * Built views and make sure there is one test for every view
    * Developed a reusable design pattern for the views and data models
    * Used [A.I.](AI.md) to get a better understanding of data types in my application
    * Used [A.I.](AI.md) to build data models in React
    * Had [A.I.](AI.md) write function stubs for views of data type
    * Learned how to identify data types and create function stubs for views of data type
* What will I do?  Design for Milestone 4
    * Implement the designed views in the ShopZone application.
    * Create and configure routing to navigate between different views.
    * Write unit tests for the implemented views and components.
    * Ensure that the application follows the established design patterns and guidelines.
    * Prepare the application for user testing and feedback collection.
* What challenges do I have?
    * Connecting the views to the backend API to fetch and display real data.
    * Integrating the frontend with the backend is complex, especially with API endpoints or data format mismatches
    * Lack of knowledge of React and how to create data and views 
    * As the design specialist for this milestone, the majority of my challenge revolves around the fact that I am still learning how to use React and how to implement data types and views on our application. Furthermore, we are trying to connect ShopZone to an Amazon API so we could get real products on our site, but this seems to be a complex technical problem. I think the most valuable part of this role is to maintain effective communciation with team members so that we can maintain consistency within our application and development process.
* Engineering investment
    * I spent about 4 hours on Design for Milestone 2
    * Our team met for 6 hours 
* 5-minute Video Demo
