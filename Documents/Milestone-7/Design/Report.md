# Engineering Report

## Milestone 7 - Design - Elmore Siahaan

* What did I do?
    * Created report that outlines our data management policies
    * Developed DevOps strategies to streamline our processes and increase the velocity of application improvements
    * Used [A.I.](AI.md) to get a better understanding of data management policies
    * Used [A.I.](AI.md) to understand how to scale our application's server to handle more users
    * Had [A.I.](AI.md) recommend various types of monitoring tools we could implement to benefit our tech stack
    * Learned the importance of data management and devops strategies in improving the scalability of our product
* What will I do?  Design Role
    These are some things that the design role should focus on in future milestones.
    * User-Centric Design: Prioritize user needs for enhanced satisfaction.
    * Brand Consistency: Maintain cohesive ShopZone branding.
    * Cross-Functional Collaboration: Collaborate with dev and product teams seamlessly.
    * Data-Driven Iteration: Use data for informed design decisions and A/B testing.
    * Continuous Learning: Stay updated on design trends for ongoing innovation.
* What challenges do I have?
    * Creating local storage to store product information in cart such that returning to homepage from Stripe retrieves items already added to cart
    * Integrating MongoDB to create accounts in ShopZone application
    * Lack of knowledge of mongoDB or database technologies to implement in our web application
    * As the design specialist for this milestone, the majority of my challenge revolves around understanding data management and devops strategies to integrate
    within out development process. In terms of technical challenges, we are still struggling with creating an account feature in our application through the use of 
    MongoDB database. Nonetheless, I think the most valuable part of design role is to maintain effective communication with team members so that we can maintain consistency within our application and development process.
* Engineering investment
    * I spent about 3 hours on Design for Milestone 7
    * Our team met for 6 hours
