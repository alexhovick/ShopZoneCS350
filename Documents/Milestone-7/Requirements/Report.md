## Milestone 7 - Requirements - Alex Hovick

* What did I do?
    * Worked with our team to identify 3 defects.
        * Cart Display not resizing correctly.
        * Item price is not placed in correct spot.
        * Webpage immediatly shows "It Broke" when loading the page.
    * After discussing with the team, we decided on the Cart Display as the other two defects were either to small to fix or not high enough priority. 
    * Worked with the team to identify 3 enhancements.
        * Update Sign in and log in page
        * Multiple pages of results
        * A button to press to search rather than just the enter button.
    * Again, after discussion we felt the most important and practicle enhancement was to Update the Sign in and Log In page.
    * Worked with the team to identify 3 New Features we could implement.
        * Order History
        * Wish List
        * Edit Profile
    * Our decision was to implement the order history, as that was one of our original user stories we wanted to implement and will make the most impact for the user.
    * After this, I worked with ChatGPT, using AI prompts, to find and prioritize solutions.
    * Worked with the team to decide the solution we are going to implement for the chosen Defect, Enhancement, and New Feature.
    
* What challenges did I have?
    *  I didn't have a lot of challenges, as Requirements feels like my natural fit.
    * One challenge I did have was when working with the team we had a very clear idea of the defect, enhancement, and new feature we wanted to implement, but because of this we had a harder time chosing other options. Once we did, we did find that some of our other options were better than our original ideas so we changed which ones we chose afterwards.
* Engineering investment
    * Individually I spent about 3.5 hours for Milestone 7
    * Our team met for 6 hours
* 5-minute Video Demo
    * Added in [Video.md file](Video.md)
