Defect: The Cart Display  is not resizing correctly 
**Identify the CSS Issue:**
   - Analyze the CSS styles applied to the Cart Display. Determine if there are any conflicting styles, fixed widths, or other issues that might be preventing it from resizing correctly.

**Use Responsive Design:**
   - Ensure that the styles applied to the Cart Display follow responsive design principles. Use percentage-based widths or max-width properties to allow the Cart Display to adapt to different screen sizes.


Enhancement: Update the Sign in and Log in page to change after a user 
enters information rather than just reseting the page.
**Real-time Feedback:**
   - Provide real-time feedback to users as they enter information. Utilize JavaScript to dynamically update the page elements, such as showing checkmarks for valid inputs or error messages for invalid ones. This creates a more interactive and responsive user experience.


New Feature: Being able to view previous orders made.
**Order History Page:**
   - Create a dedicated page displaying a comprehensive list of the user's previous orders. Include key details such as order date, items ordered, quantity, total cost, and order status.
