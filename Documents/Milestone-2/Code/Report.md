## Milestone 2 - Code - Seth Hatch

* What did I do?
    * I watched a tutorial on setting up a basic React application.
    * From the tutorial, I developed some files' code structure and basic code for our application.
    * Additionally, I added to the tools we will use: vite for better development and tailwind for better CSS.
    * Used [A.I.](AI.md) to help develop some basic features, acting as a foundation to build from.
    * I made a header and a product card component from what the A.I. created.
    * Next, I took what the A.I. created and made temporary home and product pages to help add items to the cart.
    * Next, I created the cart page and implemented adding, deleting, and changing the quantity of an item.
    * From this, I have learned how to create react components, have data persist throughout different pages, and use the JSX language.
* What will I do?  Test for Milestone 3
    * Develop a prototype of our core features
    * Try implementing an iterative approach when developing the prototype
* What challenges do I have?
    * I had a few challenges, the biggest being the website breaking, and I couldn't identify the issue for a while, so I decided to restart from the template and slowly add the code back in to see what broke it. From this, I did not find the issue, and the code started to work, and it never broke like this again.
    * Another challenge was learning the react/JSX language since I have never used it. This wasn't too difficult, and I picked it up pretty well. I now feel more comfortable using it.
* Engineering investment
    * I spent about 10 hours on code for Milestone 2
    * Our team met for 6 hours 
* 5-minute Video Demo
