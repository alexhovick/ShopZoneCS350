# Engineering Report

## Milestone 2 - Test - Alex Hovick

* What did I do?
    * Set up a new server on Netlify that was connected to our github
    * Developed a stronger understanding for automated deployment, specifically how Netlify has 0-click automatic deployment. 
    * Created a [Page Tester](PageTester.md) that can be used on a local computer
    * Used [A.I.](AI.md)to get a better understanding of React unit Tests
    * Used [A.I.](AI.md) to create an Automated Page Tester
    * Had [A.I.](AI.md) write a React unit test to Add product view.
    * Learned that React does not have an equivelant to Django data models, the differences between Django models being on the server side and React being used for user interface, and how to use javascript classes and objects to represent data structures.  
* What will I do?  Test for Milestone 3
    * Currently, our website only deploys the main index.html file. Luckly since we are using Netlify, it is pretty simple to have it run the app code rather than the index.html. In Netlify we can directly put the build commands rather than having to do it in a netlify.toml file, so once the simple prototype is finished I will be able to make those changes in Netlify.
    * Verify that the deployment process is smooth and that the application is correctly deployed to the production environment.
* What challenges do I have?
    * Unable to have website deploy prototype as it is incomplete at time of me filling out this report.
    * Unable to get python on local terminal
    * I haven't had a lot of challenges for Milestone 2, as Netlify handles the automated deployment. I have been working on getting a stronger understanding of what the rest of my team is working on. I still feel very overwhelmed and confused as this is my first time working on a website, react, and even VSCode. I still have a long way to go to catch up to the rest of my team but I am making progress.
* Engineering investment
    * I spent about 8 hours on Test for Milestone 2
    * Our team met for 6 hours 
* 5-minute Video Demo
    * Added under Video Folder
