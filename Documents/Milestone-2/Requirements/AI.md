## Explain how to create a feature list for a software MVP and a future enhancement list (each with 20 elements).

Creating a feature list for a Software Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and a Future Enhancement list is a crucial step in the software development process. The MVP feature list should include essential features to launch a basic, functional version of your software, while the Future Enhancement list should outline additional features and improvements you plan to add after the MVP is released. Here's how you can create both lists:

Creating a Feature List for the MVP (Minimum Viable Product):
Define the Core Problem: Start by clearly defining the problem your software aims to solve. Understand the primary pain points or needs of your target users.
User Stories and Use Cases: Break down the user interactions with your software into specific user stories or use cases. These should describe what users will do with your software.
Prioritize: Prioritize user stories based on their importance and impact on solving the core problem. Consider the Must-Have, Should-Have, and Could-Have categories.
Keep it Minimal: In the MVP phase, focus on the absolute minimum features required to solve the core problem. Avoid adding unnecessary complexity.
Functional Requirements: Create detailed functional requirements for each feature. These should specify what the software should do, including input, processing, and output.
UI/UX Design: If applicable, outline the basic user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design elements needed to support the core features. Keep it simple and user-friendly.
Development and Testing: Ensure that each feature has a clear acceptance criteria for testing purposes. Define what success looks like for each feature.
Technical Considerations: List any technical requirements or constraints that need to be addressed, such as specific platforms, databases, or APIs.
Estimate Resources: Estimate the time, budget, and team resources required to develop and test the MVP features.
Review and Iterate: Review the MVP feature list with stakeholders and iterate as necessary to refine the scope and ensure alignment with the core problem.
Creating a Future Enhancement List:
Once you have a clear MVP feature list, you can start planning for future enhancements:
User Feedback: Collect user feedback from the MVP's initial release to identify areas for improvement and additional features.
Market Research: Stay updated on industry trends and competitor offerings to identify features that can make your software more competitive.
Brainstorming: Conduct brainstorming sessions with your team to generate ideas for future enhancements. Encourage creativity and innovation.
Prioritization: Prioritize the enhancement ideas based on factors like user demand, business value, and technical feasibility.
Feature Descriptions: For each enhancement, create detailed feature descriptions that outline what the feature does, why it's valuable, and how it aligns with the product's vision.
Resource Estimation: Estimate the resources needed for each enhancement, including development time, testing, and any additional costs.
Timeline: Create a rough timeline for when you anticipate implementing each enhancement. Consider dependencies between features.
Communication: Share the enhancement list with stakeholders, including the development team, product managers, and investors, to get buy-in and feedback.
Continuous Review: Regularly review and update the enhancement list as priorities and market conditions change.
Iterate: As you develop and release enhancements, gather user feedback and iterate on the list to ensure it remains aligned with the evolving needs of your users and the goals of your software.
Remember that software development is an iterative process, and both the MVP and future enhancements should align with your product's overall vision and goals. Prioritization is key, as you'll likely have limited resources and time to implement all features at once.

## Estimate the effort required to build these features

Estimating the effort required to build the features for a shopping application MVP can vary significantly based on several factors, including the complexity of the features, the size and expertise of your development team, the technology stack you're using, and any existing codebase or infrastructure. Effort estimation is typically done in person-hours or person-days. Here's a rough estimate for each feature in terms of development effort:

User Registration and Authentication:

1. User registration with email or social media - 40-60 hours
2. Login and password reset functionality - 30-40 hours
3. Guest checkout option - 20-30 hours

Product Browsing:

4. Product catalog with categories and filters - 50-70 hours
