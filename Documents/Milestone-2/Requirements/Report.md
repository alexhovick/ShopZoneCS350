## Milestone 2 - Requirements - Elmore Siahaan

* What did I do?
    * Created a list of features that will be delivered in Phase 1 of the project
    * Developed a stronger understanding for value proposition
    * Created a user stories page with 20 specific features, and 20 future enhancements
    * Used [A.I.](AI.md)to get a better understanding of MVP in software development
    * Used [A.I.](AI.md) to build 20 features that should be in the MVP
    * Had [A.I.](AI.md) describe the features as user stories
    * Learned how to create MVP and prioritize feature list based on value to create product backlog
* What will I do?  Requirements for Milestone 3
    * Plan sprints to implement features in our web application
    * Verify that the product backlog is completed starting from the top with the most important features down to the bottom
    * Discuss product backlog and collect feedback from stakeholders about our application 
    * Collaborate with Test to make sure every feature is tested appropriately and meets the defined criteria
    * Create documentation to support users, developers, and stakeholders
* What challenges do I have?
    * If the application experiences increased use, the current infrastructure might not have the capability to maintain performance
    * E-commerce is a competitive landscape and ShopZone needs to set itself apart from competitors
    * As the requirements specialist for this milestone, I did not have much challenges since the majority of the work is to create MVP and prioritizing the feature list to create our initial product backlog. I think the most valuable part of this role is to maintain effective communciation with team members to make sure we are on the same page regarding how our application will be implemented.
* Engineering investment

    * Our team met for 6 hours
