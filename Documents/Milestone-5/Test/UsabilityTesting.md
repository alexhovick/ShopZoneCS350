# Usability Testing

## PixlPix

**Usability Testing Report for PixlPix Webpage Application**


**Tester:** Elmore Siahaan

**Background:**
PixlPix is a webpage application designed to simulate a social media platform, enabling users to create accounts, log in, post pictures, delete pictures, and interact with content from other users.

**Usability Testing Objectives:**
The primary objectives of the usability testing were to evaluate the user interface design, password complexity feedback, and the user-friendliness of the application, with a focus on creating an account and viewing content from other accounts.

**Testing Procedure:**
I conducted usability testing for the features presented, focusing on the following aspects:

1. **User Interface Design:**
   - The current user interface design was assessed for its symmetry and cohesiveness.
   - I examined the overall layout and visual consistency of the application.

2. **Account Creation:**
   - Attempted to create an account as a new user.
   - Evaluated the feedback and error messages provided during the account creation process.

3. **Content Visibility:**
   - Examined the ease of accessing and viewing pictures and the feed from other user accounts.

**Key Findings:**
The usability testing revealed several important observations:

1. **User Interface Design:**
   - The user interface design lacks symmetry and cohesiveness, which can affect the overall user experience.
   - Some aspects of the layout and visual elements could be improved for a more consistent and appealing appearance.

2. **Account Creation:**
   - During the account creation process, I encountered an issue with password complexity.
   - While my password was rejected for being too simple, the error message provided was not very noticeable within the page. Enhancing the visibility of error messages can improve the user experience.

3. **Content Visibility:**
   - Viewing pictures and feed from other accounts was not as user-friendly as expected.
   - The process for accessing and interacting with content could be made more intuitive and engaging.

**Recommendations:**
Based on the findings, here are some recommendations to improve the PixlPix webpage application:

1. **User Interface Design:**
   - Consider enhancing the symmetry and cohesiveness of the user interface to create a more visually appealing and consistent design.

2. **Account Creation:**
   - Improve the visibility and noticeability of error messages, particularly in cases where password complexity requirements are not met. This will help users quickly identify and address issues.

3. **Content Visibility:**
   - Enhance the user-friendliness of accessing and interacting with content from other accounts to create a more engaging and seamless experience.

**Conclusion:**
The usability testing of PixlPix revealed opportunities for improvement in user interface design, password complexity feedback, and content visibility. Addressing these recommendations can lead to an enhanced user experience and a more user-friendly application.


## ShopZone

**Usability Evaluation Report for ShopZone Webpage Application**

**Evaluator:** Individual from another group

**Background:**
ShopZone is a webpage application that enables users to browse products, select items, specify quantities, and add products to their virtual shopping cart. The application integrates with the Amazon API, allowing users to access detailed product descriptions and Amazon ratings. However, the API integration has a noticeable impact on the application's performance, resulting in slower response times. The user interface design is noteworthy, incorporating design principles such as symmetry and grouping. However, it's important to note that the account and checkout features are currently non-functional, with recommendations for future development.

**Usability Evaluation Objectives:**
The primary objectives of the usability evaluation were to assess the following aspects of the ShopZone webpage application:

1. **Performance:** Evaluate the impact of the Amazon API integration on the application's speed and responsiveness.
2. **User Interface Design:** Assess the visual design and user interface elements, with a focus on design principles.
3. **Functionality:** Identify areas where the application currently lacks functionality, specifically in the account and checkout features.

**Testing Methodology:**
The evaluation was conducted by an individual evaluator through exploration of the application's features, with a focus on performance, user interface design, and functionality.

**Key Findings:**
The usability evaluation revealed the following key findings:

1. **Performance:**
   - The integration with the Amazon API impacts the application's performance, resulting in slower response times. This may affect the user experience, particularly for users with limited patience.
   - Recommendations for optimizing the integration were suggested to improve performance.

2. **User Interface Design:**
   - The user interface design was found to be visually appealing and in line with design principles, including symmetry and grouping. This contributes to the application's aesthetic appeal and user-friendliness.

3. **Functionality:**
   - Notably, the application currently lacks functionality in the areas of account management and checkout. These features are critical for a comprehensive shopping experience and have been recommended for future development.

**Recommendations:**
Based on the findings from the individual evaluator's evaluation, the following recommendations are suggested:

1. **Performance Optimization:**
   - The integration with the Amazon API should be optimized to minimize its impact on application performance, leading to a smoother and more responsive user experience.

2. **Functionality Development:**
   - Prioritize the development of the account and checkout features to provide users with a complete and functional shopping experience.

**Conclusion:**
ShopZone is a visually appealing webpage application that integrates with the Amazon API. However, the performance optimization and development of essential features, such as account management and checkout functionality, should be addressed to enhance the overall usability and functionality of the application. Other than these unimplemented features, the application is user intuitive and works excellent.
