## Milestone 5 - Test - Elmore Siahaan

* Current Page [here](https://shopzone-app.netlify.app/)

* What did I do?
    * Learned from A.I. how to write Cypress code to test our web application and React code
    * Collaborated with team members to develop unimplemented features, such as log in and checkout
    * Conducted testing of the application for existing and new features
    * Ensured the test framework met the required test coverage standards, which we aimed at 90%
    * Created code and Cypress tool to create around 50% of code being tests
    * Discussed improvement strategies with design, requirements, and code for current state of our application
* What will I do?  Code for Milestone 5
   * Identify potential areas of improvement in the testing process and uncover any gaps in the test coverage
   * Seek feedback from other team members to ensure testing framework meets our current needs
   * Communicate ongoing testing activities, such as highlighting any issues or concerns and sharing the overall progress towards meeting our project goals
* What challenges do I have?
    * The main challenge I had for this milestone was solving our issues related with implementing new features into our application, namely log in and checkout
    * Cypress was a new tool that I had zero experience with, so learning how to get started was a bit challenging
    * Other testing tools that ChatGPT recommended were researched and also tried in our application, but Cypress was much easier to use
    * The testing tool had a user friendly interface which made it easier to visualize issues within our code, through issues highlighted by the framework
    * Implementing log in was challenging since there are many ways to address it but we were able to find a tutorial that would help us with applying accounts to our application
    * Checkout is still being worked on since we are not sure if we want to make it functional or just a visual page
* Engineering investment
    * I spent about 5 hours on Code for Milestone 5
    * Our team met for 7 hours 
* 5-minute Video Demo
