## Milestone 5 - Code - Alex Hovick

* What did I do?
  * I started with asking [A.I.](AI.md) how to do TDD.
  * I looked looked up stripe docs for the checkout .
  * Next I implemented a server that accepts cartData and sends you to checkout.
  * I created a Test Driven Log for the features I am working on [TDD](TestDrivenLog.md).


* What will I do? Code for Milestone 6
  * Use GitHubs Copilot, and learn how this will help in the future
  * Create a data model, views, routes, templates and tests
  * Work with AI to gain a better understanding.
* What challenges do I have?
  * This week, I was hoping to get the Login done, but our group decided to the Checkout was more important of feature, so after getting some work done on the Login I had to switch to working on the checkout.
  * I have a much weeker skill set when it comes to coding, compared to my group members so this milestone was a lot of learning and getting help from my teammates.
* Engineering investment
  * Individually I spent about 8 hours for Milestone 5
  * Our team met for 6 hours
* 5-minute Video Demo
  * Added in [Video.md file](Video.md)
