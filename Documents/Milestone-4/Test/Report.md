## Milestone 4 - Test - Dale Barriga

* What did I do?
    * Learned from A.I. how to write Jest test code to test feautres on our application
    * Setup tool to measure test coverage
    * Ran unit tests and record the test coverage
    * Setup test framework for automated testing
    * Built data tests for each view and compared lines of test code to lines of product code
    * Collaborated with Code to build our product and run test driven development
* What will I do?  Test for Milestone 5
   * Research with team members to develop our unimplemented features
   * Continue to test our application for features
   * Make sure the tests framework pass the test coverage based on standard percentage
   * Collaborate with test, design, and requirements to discuss how to improve the current state of our product
* What challenges do I have?
    * It was hard to test the complex application logic due to intricate interactions and dependencies.
    * Setting up test tools was challenging since VSCode did not have those test packages installed and I had to know which commands to execute to install those test packages
    * Maintaining high test coverage as the application evolves requires regular updates and additions to tests
    * Test driven development required effective communcation with Code which was sometimes challenging depending on our schedule
    * Identifying where the application may have behaved differently is a bit tricky
    * The API that we used changed or updated during our building process, so it was difficult to ensure that our application can adapt to these changes without breaking existing functionality
* Engineering investment
    * I spent about 5 hours on Code for Milestone 4
    * Our team met for 7 hours 
* 5-minute Video Demo
