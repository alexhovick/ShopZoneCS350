## What is a burn down graph

A burn-down graph (or burndown chart) is a visual representation commonly used in project management, particularly in Agile and Scrum methodologies, to track the progress of work over time. It provides a clear and easily understandable way to visualize how much work is left to complete in a project or sprint.

The burn-down graph typically has two axes:

1. Time: This is represented on the horizontal (x-axis) and shows the duration of the project or sprint, divided into increments such as days, weeks, or iterations.

2. Work Remaining: This is represented on the vertical (y-axis) and measures the amount of work that remains to be completed in the project or sprint. This work can be expressed in various units, such as story points, tasks, or hours.

The burn-down graph starts with a diagonal line that represents the ideal progress, showing that work should be completed at a steady rate over the project's duration. As the project progresses, the team updates the graph daily or at regular intervals to reflect the actual amount of work completed. This is done by plotting points that represent the amount of remaining work at each time interval.

A well-managed project should have the actual work remaining curve tracking closely to the ideal progress line. If the actual line is above the ideal line, it indicates that the team is falling behind schedule. If it's below the ideal line, it means the team is ahead of schedule.

Burn-down graphs are valuable tools for project managers, teams, and stakeholders as they provide insight into whether the project is on track, if adjustments are needed, and how the team is performing over time. They help teams manage scope, identify bottlenecks, and make informed decisions to ensure successful project completion.
