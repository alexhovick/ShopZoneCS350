## Milestone 4 - Requirements - Seth Hatch

* What did I do?
    * I started with asking [A.I.](AI.md) what a burn down graph is just for some background information.
    * I looked on google for examples of Burn Down Graphs.
    * Next I updated our [ProductBacklog](ProductBacklog.md) and rwmoved the last three invloving the wishlist.
    * I updated the [SprintPlan](SprintPlan.md)
        * Added times for completed features
        * Removed the last sprint.
        * Updated the Current and Estimated Velocities.
    * I turned the sprint plan into burn down graphs. One graph goes by the expected and current features completed at the end of each sprint. 
    * The other graph is the same but goes by the milestones instead of sprints.
    * The tables for the graphs are [here](BurnDownTables.md) along with the links to the graphs.
* What will I do?  Requirements for Milestone 5
    * Burn-down Graph
    * Customer Acceptance Meeting
    * Usability Tests
* What challenges do I have?
    * I didnt really have any challenges for this milestone. 
* Engineering investment
    * Individually I spent about 2 hours for Milestone 4
    * Our team met for 7 hours
* 5-minute Video Demo
    * Added in [Video.md file](Video.md)
