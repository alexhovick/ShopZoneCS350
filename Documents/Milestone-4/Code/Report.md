    * Track time invested into our web application 
    * Encountered error messages that were fixed with the help of ChatGPT

   * Research with team members to develop our unimplemented features
   * Continue to add to our application and refine the user experience
   * Collaborate with test, design, and requirements to discuss how to improve the current state of our product
* What challenges do I have?
    * Various challenges encountered with developing our application in terms of writing the code and building the architecture
    * Error messages regarding Uncaught TypeError and undefined properties
    * We currently do not have a database so the application keeps track of quantifiable items and it was hard to understand how this actually works to keep track of quantity in cart, I ended up utilizing redux to share data across the screens
    * Search bar did not work and the componenet was causing problems for test also
    * Did not know which API to use since they had pros and cons depending on latency, price, limited calls, difficulty implementing, and others
    * Our team were unsure about how to process pay information and whether we wanted to implment an actual paying method
* Engineering investment
    * I spent about 10 hours on Code for Milestone 4
    * Our team met for 7 hours 
* 5-minute Video Demo
