## Milestone 4 - Design - Alex Hovick

* What did I do?
    * Learned from A.I. what Design Patterns are.
    * Learned from A.I. how to implement Design Patterns for data models.
    * Created a design pattern for our two Data Models, Search Results and Product Details.
    * Created a design pattern for our General Purpose Views, which are Product Card, Cart, and Product Details.
    * Created a reusable design pattern for our URLs, for our Views, for our Templates, and for our Data Models.
    * Helped the Code role with the search, API, and design of the program.
* What will I do?  Design for Milestone 5
   * Use the design patterns for the checkout and the profile log in.
   * Continue to work with the Coder to finish the code. 
   * Continue to debug
* What challenges do I have?
    * I personally had a hard time wrapping my head around the idea of what a design pattern was and what our data models, views, and templates where, but with the help of my team and ChatGPT I was able to get a better understanding.
    * Overall I have a very limited understanding of the coding, but I do feel this week was a major learning experience, as I gained understanding about how the Data Models Search Results and PRoduct Details work, how they connect to the app, how the API is integrated, and how the URLs are created. I still have a lot to learn but I am definetly making progress.
* Engineering investment
    * I spent about 4 hours on Design for Milestone 2
    * Our team met for 7 hours 
* 5-minute Video Demo
    * Added in Video Folder and [here](Video.md)
