## Milestone 3 - Test - Seth Hatch

* What did I do?
    * I used [A.I.](AI.md) to give me a list of the best test frameworks for react applications.
    * I chose Jest as the test framework to use.
        * I learned jest and installed and created files for it
        * I created a test file that had a few tests that worked until the Api was implemented, and broke the tests for some reason.
        * I looked into the problem and decided to mock the Api
        * I tried to mock the Api but failed. - Spent about 8 hours doing this
    * I decided to go back to [A.I.](AI.md), and choose new test framework
    * I chose Cypress as new test framework.
        * I learned cypress and set our code up to use it.
        * I created a few test to see how it works and got them working. 
        * I created tests and then checked them and kept going until I reached 20 test
        * The 20 tests for the code are [Test_File.md](Test_File.md).
            * 17 Pass and 3 fail.
            * The fails are from testing features that arent implemented yet.
* What will I do?  Requirements for Milestone 4
    * 
* What challenges do I have?
    * Dumb jest not making it easy. 
* Engineering investment
    * Individually I spent about 10 hours on Test for Milestone 3
    * Our team met for 6 hours
* 5-minute Video Demo
    * Added in [Video.md file](Video.md)
