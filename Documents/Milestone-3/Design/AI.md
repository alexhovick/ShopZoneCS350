Reviews and ratings: User-generated content, including product reviews and ratings.

By focusing on these key data categories, you can maintain the core functionality of your app, including user registration, product discovery, transactions, and user engagement, while reducing complexity. However, keep in mind that the specific data attributes within each category may vary based on the unique features and requirements of your app. It's important to adapt these categories to suit your app's specific needs and features.

# Create react data model for User: name, email, address

In a React application, you can create a data model for a user with the following attributes: name, email, and address. You can define this data model as a JavaScript object or use a class. Here's an example using a JavaScript object:

```jsx
const user = {
  name: "",
  email: "",
  address: {
    street: "",
    city: "",
    state: "",
    postalCode: "",
    country: ""
  }
};
```

In this model:

- `name` represents the user's name.
- `email` represents the user's email address.
- `address` is an object that contains the user's address information, including `street`, `city`, `state`, `postalCode`, and `country`.

You can use this data model in your React components by initializing it in your component's state or as a variable, and then populating it with user data as needed. Here's an example of how you might use it in a React component:

```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class UserProfile extends Component {
  state = {
    user: {
      name: "John Doe",
      email: "john.doe@example.com",
      address: {
        street: "123 Main St",
        city: "Anytown",
        state: "CA",
        postalCode: "12345",
        country: "USA"
      }
    }
  };

  render() {
    const { user } = this.state;

    return (
      <div>
        <h1>User Profile</h1>
        <p>Name: {user.name}</p>
        <p>Email: {user.email}</p>
        <h2>Address</h2>
        <p>Street: {user.address.street}</p>
        <p>City: {user.address.city}</p>
        <p>State: {user.address.state}</p>
        <p>Postal Code: {user.address.postalCode}</p>
        <p>Country: {user.address.country}</p>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default UserProfile;
```

In this example, the `UserProfile` component uses the `user` data model to display the user's information, including their name, email, and address, in the rendered UI. You can update the user data in the component's state as needed, such as when fetching user information from an API or when the user updates their profile.


# Write function stubs for views of Student data type: List, Detail, Edit, Create, Delete

Sure, here are function stubs for views of a Student data type in a React application. These stubs assume you have a basic understanding of React and JSX:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

// List View
function StudentList() {
  // Implement code to fetch and display a list of students
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Student List</h1>
      {/* Render the list of students here */}
    </div>
  );
}

// Detail View
function StudentDetail({ studentId }) {
  // Implement code to fetch and display detailed information about a student by ID
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Student Detail</h1>
      {/* Render student details here based on the studentId */}
    </div>
  );
}

// Edit View
function EditStudent({ studentId }) {
  // Implement code to edit student information
  // Fetch student data by ID, display an edit form, and handle updates
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Edit Student</h1>
      {/* Render an edit form for student with studentId */}
    </div>
  );
}

// Create View
function CreateStudent() {
  // Implement code to create a new student
  // Display a form for creating a new student and handle the submission
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Create Student</h1>
      {/* Render a form to create a new student */}
    </div>
  );
}

// Delete View
function DeleteStudent({ studentId }) {
  // Implement code to delete a student
  // Prompt the user for confirmation and delete the student if confirmed
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Delete Student</h1>
      {/* Display a confirmation dialog for deleting the student with studentId */}
    </div>
  );
}

export { StudentList, StudentDetail, EditStudent, CreateStudent, DeleteStudent };
```

These React component stubs provide the structure for implementing each view of a Student data type in your application. You would typically replace the comments with actual JSX code and integrate these components into your React application, connecting them to your data source and handling user interactions as needed.
