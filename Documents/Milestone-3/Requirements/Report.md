# Engineering Report

## Milestone 3 - Requirements - Alex Hovick

* What did I do?
    * Worked with [ChatGPT](AI.md) to understand how to create a product backlog
    * Had AI explain the core features of our app
    * Had AI write a simple Sprint Plan prioritizing our Core Features.
    * Learned from AI how to measure project velocity
    * Created our own [Sprint Plan](SprintPlan.md) with 9 sprints and structured it so that we have an idea of what we will be working on in each Milestone. 
    * Reorganized our product backlog to be in line with our Sprint Plan
    * Met with our team to determine the estimated time spent for each user stoy
    * Calculated our Estimated Project Velocity to be 0.377 Features per Hour
    * Calculated our Currect Project Velocity, as we have already completed the first two sprints to be 0.375 Features per Hour
* What will I do?  Requirements for Milestone 4
    * Requirements for Milestone 4 should continue to calculate the Project Velocity as we complete more sprints to stay on track to finish by Milestone 7
    * They should also work closely with the team to ensure that the project is staying on track and getting any understanding of the progress being made
    * They should work communicate with the customer and ensure the product we are making is what the customer is looking for, that the sprints include everything we would like.
* What challenges do I have?
    * I definetly have had the least ammount of challenges this week, as I feel the Requirements role is what fits my skill set the best.
    * One Challenge I did face was having conflicting ideas on the order of some sprints with my team, but we were able to communicate well and sort out our ideas and make a plan that everyone felt confident in.
* Engineering investment
    I spent close to 9 hours on Milestone 3
    Of those 9 hours, our team met for 6 hours in Milestone 3
