## How do i create a ProductCard component in react that displays the photo, title, price, and star rating of an item?

You can create a ProductCard component in React to display the photo, title, price, and star rating of an item using the following code as a starting point. This is a basic example, and you can customize it further based on your project's specific needs.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { AiFillStar } from 'react-icons/ai';

const ProductCard = ({ item }) => {
return (
    <div className="product-card">
    <img className="product-image" src={item.product_photo} alt={item.product_title} />
        <div className="product-details">
            <h3 className="product-title">{item.product_title}</h3>
            <p className="product-price">${item.product_price}</p>
            <div className="product-rating">
            {Array.from({ length: Math.floor(item.product_star_rating) }, (_, index) => (
                        <AiFillStar key={index} className="star-icon" />
            )}
            <span className="star-rating">{item.product_star_rating}</span>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
        );
    };
```

export default ProductCard;

In this code:

- The ProductCard component takes an item prop, which should contain the necessary information about the product, including product_photo, product_title, product_price, and - - product_star_rating.

- Inside the component, an img element displays the product image with the src attribute set to the product_photo, and the alt attribute set to the product_title for accessibility.

- The product details, including the title and price, are displayed within a div element with appropriate class names for styling.

- For the star rating, we use the AiFillStar icon from the react-icons/ai package to display filled stars. The number of filled stars is determined by the product_star_rating. We create an array of star icons using Array.from and map over it to render the stars based on the integer part of the rating.

- The ProductCard component exports the entire card, which you can use in your application to display product information.

- Remember to style the component using CSS or a styling solution of your choice to achieve the desired appearance in your application.

## Create a test for ProductCard

To create a test for the ProductCard component in React, you can use testing libraries like Jest and React Testing Library. Below is an example of how to write a simple test for the ProductCard component.

First, make sure you have Jest and React Testing Library installed. If you haven't already, you can install them as development dependencies:

- npm install --save-dev jest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom

Next, you can create a test file for the ProductCard component, such as ProductCard.test.js, and write the test as follows:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { render, screen } from "@testing-library/react";
import ProductCard from "./ProductCard"; // Replace with the actual path to your ProductCard component

// Mock product data for testing
const product = {
  product_photo: "product_image_url",
  product_title: "Product Title",
  product_price: "$10.00",
  product_star_rating: 4.5,
};

test("renders ProductCard component with product data", () => {
  render(<ProductCard item={product} />);

  // Check if the product title, price, and star rating are displayed
  expect(screen.getByText("Product Title")).toBeInTheDocument();
  expect(screen.getByText("$10.00")).toBeInTheDocument();
  expect(screen.getByText("4.5")).toBeInTheDocument();

  // You can add more assertions based on the structure of your component
  // For example, check if the product image is displayed, or if specific CSS classes are applied.
});
```

In this test:

- We import the necessary testing libraries and the ProductCard component.
- We create a mock product object with sample data to simulate the data that would be passed to the ProductCard component.
- The test checks if the component renders with the product data.
- We use assertions to check if elements with the product title, price, and star rating are present in the rendered component. You can add more assertions based on your component's structure and expected behavior.
- Ensure that the paths to the component and your test file are correctly specified, and you have the required libraries and configuration for testing in your project.
